# Prompt Engineering
Jupyter notebooks of "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI & OpenAI


## Background
In the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers course, participants will learn how to employ a large language model (LLM) for the rapid development of new and powerful applications. Utilizing the OpenAI API, they will gain the ability to swiftly create functionalities that excel in innovation and value creation, overcoming challenges that were once cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or seemingly insurmountable.

This brief course, instructed by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI), delves into the workings of LLMs, imparts best practices for prompt engineering, and showcases the diverse applications of LLM APIs in tasks like:
- Summarizing (e.g., condensing user reviews)
- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- Expanding (e.g., automatically composing emails)

Participants will also gain insight into two key principles for crafting effective prompts, a systematic approach to engineering quality prompts, and the ability to construct a customized chatbot. All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, providing participants with a chance to engage directly with them in the Jupyter notebook environment for a hands-on experience in prompt engineering.

## Usage
